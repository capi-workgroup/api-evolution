# api-evolution

Discussions about issues related to the gradual evolution of the C API.
Proposals here are expected to be relatively non-controversial,
appeal to common sense, and not require big implementation or adoption efforts.

When creating an issue that summarizes some discussion elsewhere,
please link to the original discussion if you can (but *do* **summarize**).

Try to indicate how controversial you expect a particular guideline to be.

The goal of this repo is to collect the raw materials for a
[process PEP](https://peps.python.org/pep-0001/#pep-types),
to be co-authored by the C API Workgroup members
(we don't know who that will be yet, but see #14).

That process PEP will be a living document moderated by the C API Workgroup
members (listed as co-authors of the PEP), similar to PEP 8.
The dev guide will direct developers to the PEP for guidelines.
Like [PEP 8](https://peps.python.org/pep-0008/), and unlike
[standards track PEPs](https://peps.python.org/pep-0001/#pep-types),
the PEP should focus on providing actionable guidelines,
rather than on convincing the SC of the correctness of a "specification".

(I originally thought that this would be an informational PEP,
but after reading
[that section](https://peps.python.org/pep-0001/#pep-types)
of PEP 1 again, I think it should be a process PEP.)

For more radical proposals (e.g. HPy),
please open an issue in [api-revolution](https://github.com/capi-workgroup/api-revolution).
