# api-evolution

Discussions about issues related to the gradual evolution of the C API.
Proposals here are expected to be relatively non-controversial,
appeal to common sense, and not require big implementation or adoption efforts.

For more radical proposals (e.g. HPy),
please open an issue in [api-revolution](https://github.com/capi-workgroup/api-revolution).
