# api-evolution

Discussions about issues related to the gradual evolution of the C API.
Proposals here are expected to be relatively non-controversial,
appeal to common sense, and not require big implementation or adoption efforts.

When creating an issue that summarizes some discussion elsewhere,
please link to the original discussion if you can (but *do* **summarize**).

Try to indicate how controversial you expect a particular guideline to be.

The goal o this repo is to collect the raw materials for an informational PEP,
to be co-authored by the C-API workgroup members (we don't know who that will be).

For more radical proposals (e.g. HPy),
please open an issue in [api-revolution](https://github.com/capi-workgroup/api-revolution).
